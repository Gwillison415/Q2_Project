# Contributing to ShareCast

Individuals will work on their own forked branching from [Master](https://github.com/ShareCastG52/Q2_Project)   and submitting a pull request to the [Dev]  needs approval -MP) Project branch.


## Review process
As PR's are submitted,  team member A who is submitting the changes will communicate their interest in merging in features to team member B. Then time will be allotted for member B to review the changes and ask for clarification from member A as needed. Discussion will ensue and pull requests will be resolved as team members A and B get back on the same pages with new features. During this time, github Issues for the specific feature shall be reconciled and when resolved, given the go-ahead to merge.

## Communications
The ShareCast team will utilize Slack for communications of new Pull Requests and after the review process is complete, and test have been run, dev branches from Individual forks shall be merged into the master project folder. Conflicts shall be handled locally so that a minimum number of them show up when merging into the project master branch.

Members merging changes shall communicate that merges have been accepted and indicate that other team members should pull down new changes to their forks.

Github Issues will be used to identify and track various issues with specific features from the organizations' repo. As issues arise, they will be grouped by feature / milestone and closed when resolved.

## Team rights
All members will have the right to merge PR's after review process

What are the guidelines for making a PR? Here's a recommended flow:
When you are ready to submit a PR, do an interactive rebase on your branch to clean up your commit history as needed
Checkout master (or dev depending on your team's workflow) and pull down from upstream to make sure your local master (or dev) has the latest work
Checkout your feature branch again and rebase it onto the now-up-to-date master (or dev)
Push your feature branch up to origin
Submit a PR from origin's feature branch into upstream's master (or dev)
